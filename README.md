# Url Shortener 
Web Application for shortening url

Why use Url Shortener?
As you know: URL Shorteners shorten your URLs. And this is actually useful in a variety of scenarios. Think of Twitter for example: When you have a limited set of characters at your disposal, each one of them counts.A cool added value when you’re using customized short links: They’re easier to remember which can come in handy if you want to put long links on printed media for example where you typically don’t have the option to put all your UTM tags.(UTM-tag (Urchin tracking module) is a specialized parameter in the URL used by marketers to track advertising campaigns on the Internet.)
